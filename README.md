Unix Port Collection Reborn


This Repo Cotains my Implementation of the FreeBSD Port / Gentoo Portage / NetBSD pkgsrc / OpenEmbeded bitbake type of Utilities

##### The Goal is to Have a tool which can: 
  * install software from source with one command similar to FreeBSD ports
  * build packages of said ports
  * build distributions or repositories with those packages.
  * make it totaly trivial to Fix Bugs found in the ports
