Unix Port Collection Reborn


This Repo Cotains my Implementation of the FreeBSD Port / Gentoo Portage / NetBSD pkgsrc / OpenEmbeded bitbake type of Utilities
The Goal is to: 
  Have a tool which can install software from source with one command like FreeBSD ports
  Build packages of said ports
  Build distributions or repositories with those packages.
  Make it totaly trivial to Fix Bugs found in the ports
